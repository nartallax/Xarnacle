Syntax.

Code of a program consists of following parts:
	* imports, that defines what symbols could be short-referenced from the code
	* global variables, function, Class, Trait and Structure definitions
	
	* class/trait/structure declaration is:
		* data section: fields of the instance of the class/trait/structure, maybe with default value
		* method section: implementation of methods
		* (for class/trait): inheritance
		
function type definition: 
	* var int a: int => int = a => { ... }
	* val a = (int a, int b) => int { ... }
